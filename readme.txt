This file (ui1.py) is a Python script for auditing UI elements in an HTML file for compliance with company policy using the Hugging Face LLM API. Here’s how it works:

Imports:

BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML.
requests for making API calls.
jinja2 for generating an HTML dashboard.
re for parsing text responses.
Policy Definition:

Contains lists of prohibited terms, required phrases, and accessibility guidelines.
Extract UI Elements:

Reads an HTML file (input_ui.html).
Finds tags like label, input, select, option, and button.
Collects their type and text.
Validate with LLM API:

Sends each UI element and policy as a prompt to the Hugging Face API (zephyr-7b-beta model).
Uses an API token for authentication.
Receives a generated response about compliance.
Parse LLM Response:

Uses regex to extract compliance status, reason, and suggested correction from the LLM’s response.
Generate Dashboard:

Uses Jinja2 to create an HTML report (output_report.html) summarizing the compliance results.
Pipeline Execution:

Extracts elements, validates each with the LLM, parses the response, and generates the dashboard.
Prints a success message when done.
Summary:
This script automates UI compliance checks by sending UI element details to a language model API and reporting the results in an HTML dashboard.
